# EPIPY GUI

This script helps construct the commands needed to run the pipeline manager for EPIPY. EPIPY is designed to allow rapid deployment of tested research code in any order that the user desires. It also takes new research code, putting it into a tested pipeline. The intention is to remove redundant steps in analyzing data that can introduce errors, and allow for better data versioning.

## Installation
Please consult the [readme file for the whole repository](https://github.com/penn-cnt/CNT-codehub) for more information. This is a wrapper script to the main pipeline code for the lab and requires a full installation to work properly.

## Usage

You can run this code with the following command:

```
python EPIPY_GUI.py
```
