# Lab Code Repository

This repository stores code for the lab as a whole, as well as for individual projects. The lab code is thoroughly tested and can be used to create larger workflows or for exploration in interactive environments and Python notebooks.

## Folders

### `codehub`
This folder contains the core lab code organized as a mono repository. It includes:

- **`epipy.py`**: The main script that initiates larger data processing workflows.
- **`components/`**: Contains tested code for lab use, supporting various functionality within workflows. It also can be used for directly importing code into interactive environments/python notebooks.
- **`utils`**: A collection of utility scripts designed to assist with a wide range of tasks.

### `device-name_project-name_optional_subdir-name`
This is a placeholder for creating new folders in `scripts/`. The naming convention is as follows:
- **Device Name**: E.g., `scalp`, `intracranial`, `imaging`, etc.
- **Project Name**: The name of the specific project.
- **Optional Subdirectory Name**: Any additional tags to further differentiate between folders related to the same project.
