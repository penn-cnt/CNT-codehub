# This file defines preprocessing steps as well as their keyword arguments.
# By externalizing the order, we can use reproducable code and allow individuals to comprehend/change the preprocessing steps quickly.
# This file can be called in the main.py file. Alternatively, the main body of the script can query the user for steps, then generate a similar file to this one with user specified filename.

# Available keywords:
## step_nums: integer. Array defining which steps in the preprocessing pipeline this should be run.
## order: List of integers. The order of the filter. default=3
## freqs: List of integer arrays. The frequencies to perform the filter on in each step. 
## filter_type: List of strings. Type of filter. default='bandpass'
### Options: {‘lowpass’, ‘highpass’, ‘bandpass’, ‘bandstop’}
