This code is designed to facilitate the merging of scalp EEG data collected by different sources. This is a temporary stand-in for DN3, which was originally specced to be a method for preparing data for deep learning tasks. At present DN3 is not ready for lab-wide implementation. This code aims to only prepare the data for deep learning ingested, and leaves the metadata for creating a model to the user.

# Prerequisites
In order to use this repository, you must have access to Python 3+. 

# Installation

In order to install any of the common library code, we provide instructions for installing the libraries.

# Documentation
TBD

## Repository Structure

A short description of some of the top-level directories and files are as follows:

### core_libraries
This folder contains the submodules and build files that make up the core libraries used for lab-wide projects.

### documents
This folder contains various research documents associated with a project (i.e. SoPs, Pipeline diagrams, etc.) as well as code documentation (e.g.document strings) for the various libraries.

### scripts
This folder contains user-defined scripts on a per project basis.

### unit_tests
This folder contains unit tests for validating new/altered code at both the machine level and model level.
