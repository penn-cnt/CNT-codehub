# Making configuration files

This example shows how to create preprocessing and feature extraction configuration files in one of two ways.

## Guided generation

If you run pipeline_manager without providing a preprocessing or feature extraction configuration file, the code will prompt you through the generation of a simple yaml file.

This method is not recommended for more complex configuration files that include many steps or gridded/looped inputs.
